# Trebbul
Trebbul is a social-media music rating website that allows users to share what they are listening to and how they like music with ease. Users will be tasked with creating a unique profile that they can share with friends to curate their music tastes. The Website will also offer many other features such as implementing a ranking/review system for albums and individual songs ( Albums alone will only be given a review section where users can write a review, and songs will only have a scoring metric no written reviews. To keep things organized) which will then be presented as a post on the main feed for the app.  

Furthermore, the website will contain an activity section where you can see what your friends are currently listening to, it will allow you to play a snippet of the song if you so decide ( this feature has not been finalized). Lastly, the website will have a search bar for looking up songs and adding albums to your future listens. We hope to have 4 main sections to this website ( Profile, Activity feed, Ranking/Reviews, and search bar), these sections will be functional through the implementation of APIs and beautiful UI/UX experiences.
